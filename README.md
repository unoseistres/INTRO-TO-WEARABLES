# INTRO-TO-WEARABLES
Introduction to wearables, sensors, and narrative

## 3/11 BASICS OF CIRCUITS 
OBJECTIVE: Teach the basics of circuitry through wearable electronics. Participants will start by creating their own parallel circuits and transition to programming with neopixels.

1. Basic circuitry

  </p>

  - LED/coin cell orientation

  - Create parallel switch circuit- LED, nylon fabric tape

  </p>

    - One LED light up switch
    - Where have you seen a parallel circuit before? (christmas lights, etc)
    - Diagram on how energy flows
    - What is ground?
      - ground is the reference point in an electrical circuit from which voltages are measured, a common return path for             electric current
      - What is VBATT, 3.3V = current flow places
      - Rest are digital pins 
2. Programming Neopixels
  - What are neopixels? 
    - Needs data but how do we send it data? 
  - Circuit diagram
    - Flora- microcontroller- runs a piece of code. Only knows to do that.
      - Reprogram (by uploading new code) it but only does the one thing
      - [Flora diagram](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/2845)
      - How is data flowing?
  - Input
      - Are pins where you can connect devices that supply information to the microcontroller. - sensors, switches
          - Digital input - refers to a binary state. On or off, high or low. 
          - Analog input- refers to pins that can accommodate a range of values. You can accomplish a more varied effect.
  - Output
      - Are pins where information is delivered from the microcontroller in the form of varying voltage.- LEDs, motors, and         speakers. 
      
3. Sewing your circuit

  </p>
  
  - How do you sew?
    - Look out for direction
    - Sewing snaps
    - Positive and Negative connections don’t have breaks HOWEVER data connections do. 
    - Upload simple strand test
    - Arduino programming structure  
    
4. HOMEWORK
  - Come in with an animation
    - Blink animation ⇒ snake animation 
      - INTRO, BLINK, CHASER 
    - Feeling animation: 	
      - High
      - Crushed
      - Magnificent

## 3/13 SENSING THE BODY 
1. Introduction to Arduino
  - Go over Animation homework- Questions? Hurdles? Discoveries?

## Introduction to Sensors
2. Each group will have a sensor to work with
 - Accelerometer (2)
 - Stretch sensor (2)
 - Mic
 - Capacitive touch

3. Construct circuit  
 - Present back your circuits
    - What is happening in your circuit?
    - What code did you use to work with it?
    - How is this working (in plain english)?

BREAK

4. Where does your sensor live on the body?
 - Examples of how to migrate your circuit  
 - What is your sensor potentially highlighting?
    - What kind of gestures does your sensor invite?
    - What kind of meaning does the data have? 

5. HOMEWORK
  - Create a 2 min max. performance
    - No words
    - Has to involve more than one body
    - Prompt- “I have to tell you a secret”
